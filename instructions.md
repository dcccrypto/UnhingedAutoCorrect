## Stats

The extension tracks:
- Number of words translated
- Number of emojis added

You can reset these stats using the "Reset" button.

## Troubleshooting

If the extension freezes your browser:
1. Disable "Replace Images" as this feature is resource-intensive
2. Try refreshing the page
3. In extreme cases, go to extension management and disable the extension

If translations aren't working:
1. Make sure "Enable Translation" is toggled on
2. Refresh the page you're viewing
3. Check if you're on a supported page type

## Performance Tips

- The image replacement feature uses significant resources, especially on image-heavy sites
- Use NSFW Mode only when appropriate
- Adjust emoji intensity lower if you notice performance issues

Enjoy your unhinged browsing experience! ðŸ’€
